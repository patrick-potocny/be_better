### About BeBetter
BeBetter is an AI chatbot that allows users to unlock their full potential, whether to improve their health, career, or personal life. Our chatbot can guide every step of the way through full on conversations about any issue that the user presents to it. It is powered by the currently most advanced NLP (Natural Language Processing) model called "text-davinci-003" developed by OpenAI. My main motivation to create this chatbot was seeing tons of my peers and people around me missing purpose and goals in life, and just going along and not having much control. Seeing the rise of AI and its ability to have conversations with people and help them felt like the perfect personal project. This project is also meant to serve as a portfolio piece that demonstrates my proficiency in using React and ability to design and build fully functional, responsive and accessible front-end applications.

### Design & Development

To build the BeBetter Web-Application, I began by designing it in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/4AURxqf1wol5sgG5LtLk5o/beBetter?node-id=0%3A1&t=lCNATUCWb9HMYqBc-1) and utilizing my UI/UX design [skills](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/professional-cert/DZUJWASR2WSS?utm_campaign=sharing_cta&utm_content=cert_image&utm_medium=certificate&utm_product=prof&utm_source=link).

I did my research and went through [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)'s API documentation to select the best model and its configuration for my chatbot. I chose the text-davinci-003 model because it's the most advanced and handles conversations the best out of all the options available.

In determining the framework for building the React app, I carefully evaluated my options and ultimately chose [Create-React-App (CRA)](https://create-react-app.dev/) due to its ease of use and simplicity in getting the app up and running, as well as the app's lack of need for server-side rendering. To ensure a structured and maintainable CSS, I adopted the [BEM](https://getbem.com/) naming style and paired it with [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/). To ensure accessibility for all users, I incorporated the use of [ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) attributes in my HTML design, specifically to enhance the experience for individuals utilizing assistive technology such as screen readers.

Throughout the development process, I adhered to best practices such as __TDD__ (Test-Driven Development) and __DRY__ (Don't Repeat Yourself). For testing, I utilized [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) in conjunction with [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/), and for version control, I employed [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
